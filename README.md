# portfolio
A new portfolio, using the hours of knowledge I crammed during the first 3rd of bootcamp.
All pages are writtin into a single html file. This includes all menu tabs and layers, like the photo gallery. There is nothing fancy here, just wanted to see if I could write all these features out without using sample code.

Update 12/12/2019

Added more projects to the portfolio page, as per class assignment.
